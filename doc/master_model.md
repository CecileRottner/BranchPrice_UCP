# Master problem

## Classes "Master Model"

### Master_Model (virtual)

Class __Master_Model__ (virtual) contains indicators common to all master problems, regardless of decomposition type.
In particular :
* indicators on the instance solved
* Generated interval up set inequalities indicators (total number, pointers to inequalities)
* Current fractional solution (x_frac)
* Associated dual values (totalDualCostList)
* Counter of pricing iterations

Pure virtual methods :
- computeFracSol : from extended variables lambda, computes solution in original variables (depends on the type of decomposition chosen)
- discardVar :
- restoreVar :

### MasterSite_Model

Class MasterSite_Model represents the master problem of a unit/site decomposition.

Various decomposition options are available in this framework :

* classical unit or site decomposition 
* start-up decomposition : only start-up and shut-down decisions are taken in the master problem
* Residual demand decomposition : residual coupling demand constraints are added to subproblems corresponding to each site

See Section 8.2.2 of https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02052101/document for more details on these decomposition options.

### MasterTime_Model



## Classes "Master Variables"


For each decomposition type, we also have a class representing extended variables generated by column generation :

- for unit/site decomposition : class __Master_Variable__

- for time decompositon : class __MasterTime_Variable__

Theses classes keep a pointer to one SCIP variable, as well as indicators regarding this variable : to which unit/site or time step it corresponds, the subproblem extreme point it stands for (eg: up/down plan for 1 unit) and its cost.
