# Master problem

## Classes "Master Model"

### Master_Model (virtual)

Class __Master_Model__ (virtual) contains indicators common to all master problems, regardless of decomposition type.
In particular :
* indicators on the instance solved
* Generated interval up set inequalities indicators (total number, pointers to inequalities)
* Current fractional solution (x_frac)
* Associated dual values (totalDualCostList)
* Counter of pricing iterations

Pure virtual methods :
- computeFracSol : from extended variables lambda, computes solution in original variables (depends on the type of decomposition chosen)
- discardVar :
- restoreVar :

### MasterSite_Model

### MasterTime_Model



## Classes "Master Variables"


For each decomposition type, we also have a class representing extended variables generated by column generation :

- for unit/site decomposition : class __Master_Variable__

- for time decompositon : class __MasterTime_Variable__
